# The Arrowhead Broker â€“ Service Description

## Abstract

## 1. Overview

The `Broker` system, illustrated below, facilitates token ownership negotitation, accounting, and tagging.
It acts as a trusted intermediary, allowing its consumers to access an arbitrary _trading platform_, which allows them to exchange `Token`s representing arbitrary value.

## 1.1. Brokering Sessions

Whenever a properly authorized Arrowhead system consumes the `Brokering` service produced by a `Broker` system, a session is created or resumed. The session is associated with the certificate of the consuming service, and stores its _trading platform identity_, as well as information about any on-going `Token` exchanges. The _trading platform identity_ of a consuming service can be queried via the `BrokerAccounting` service `getAgent` function.

## 2. Service Interfaces

### 2.1. BrokerAccounting

The `BrokerAccounting` service, depicted below, accounts for past exchange events as well as the identity it uses to represent its consumer.
The services provides no sophisticated analytical capabilities; it serves lists of `Exchange`s, `Ownership`s and `Token`s in response to simpler queries.
If data analysis is desired, the service can provide any data required to any properly authorized analysis service.

#### 2.1.1 Functions

__getAgent__ Gets `Party` object used by the Broker system to represent the consuming service calling this function.

__getExchanges__ Queries for any `Exchange` objects the consuming service is allowed to see.

__getOwnerships__ Queries for any `Ownership` objects the consuming service is allowed to see.

__getTokens__ Queries for any `Token` objects the consiming service is allowed to see.

### 2.2. Brokering

The below depicted `Brokering` service is used by consuming service to _send_ messages for creating or updating _Exchange State Machines_ (ESMs).
The service is always used together with the `BrokeringPush` service, which is used for _receiving_ ESM updates made by any exchange counter-parties.

#### 2.2.1. Functions

__propose__ Proposes a `Token` exchange.

__accept__ Accepts a _qualified_ `Proposal`, making it pending confirmation.
If the accepted `Proposal` is not qualified, or if its deadline has expired, the call fails.

__reject__ Rejects a _qualified_ `Proposal`.
If the rejected `Proposal` is not qualified, the call fails.

__confirm__ Confirms an accepted `Proposal`, making it binding.
If the confirmed `Proposal` is not qualified and accepted, the call fails.

__abort__ Aborts accepted exchange `Proposal`.
If the aborted `Proposal` is not qualified and accepted, the call fails.

### 2.3. BrokeringPush

Each service consuming the `Brokering` service must also expose a `BrokeringPush` service in order to receive exchange proposals and updates.
If, however, the corresponding `Brokering` implementation exposes its functions through a chat-like protocol, such as XMPP or JSON-RPC, then this service exists only implicitly.
In that case, the same communication channel established by the `Brokering` consumer is used by the `Brokering` service to send the `BrokeringPush` messages.

#### 2.3.1. Functions

__propose__ Called to notify about an incoming `Token` exchange `Proposal`.

__accept__ Called to notify about a previously sent `Proposal` being accepted.

__reject__ Called to notify about a previously sent `Proposal` being rejected.

__confirm__ Called to notify about a previously accepted `Proposal` being confirmed.

__abort__ Called to notify about a previously accepted `Proposal` being aborted.
